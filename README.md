# Dashboard React Admin Project

This is a front-end project made using React. It has multiple pages that are as follows:
- Main Dashboard page with all the cumulative values displayed in a beautiful layout
- Calendar page for keeping track of events and adding and removing them (some initial events are already there)
- Profile form page that creates a dummy user object that is printed on the dev console
- FAQ Page made using MUI Accordion component'
- Team, Contacts, and Invoices pages made using the MUI Data Grid
- Bar, Line, Pi, and Geography chart built using Nivo Charts (the website provides template code that was modified to create the output)

The project uses multiple libraries which are listed as follows
- Nivo Charts (For line, bar, pie and geography charts)
- React Pro Sidebar
- Material UI (for light/dark mode, MUI icons, box component, data grid, MUI Accordion)
- FullCalendar (for events calendar)
- Formik (for profile form page)
- Yup (allows validation)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
